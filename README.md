# GrannySquareBlanketDesigner
The Granny Square Layout Generator is a Python application designed to help crocheters and craft enthusiasts visually plan the layout of granny square blankets. By inputting the number and colors of your granny squares, the application generates a pattern layout, allowing you to visualize and plan your blanket's design before assembly.
